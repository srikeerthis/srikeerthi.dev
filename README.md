This repository contains implementation of my portfolio.

I am exploring frameworks in web development and I am experimenting with [Astro-Sphere](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-sphere).

It is primarily Astro, Tailwind and Typescript, with a very small amount of SolidJS for stateful components.

## üíª Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

Replace npm with your package manager of choice. `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `bun`, etc
