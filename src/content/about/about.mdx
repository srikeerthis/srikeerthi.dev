---

[cite_start]I recently graduated with a _Master's degree in Computer Science_ from the University of Texas at Arlington[cite: 2]. I am an experienced software engineer who has transitioned from individual contributor to **Technical Lead** roles, with a passion for **Open Source**, **Cloud Architecture (AWS)**, and **Machine Learning**.

## Professional Experience

**Cleverstreet.AI (Technical Lead)**
* [cite_start]**Role:** Architected and shipped a "0→1" Gen-AI video platform in just **2 months**[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, Next.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, Fly.io, GitHub Actions[cite: 23].
* **Impact:** Built the full-stack system, including payment infrastructure (Stripe) and CI/CD pipelines. [cite_start]Optimized system performance by tuning latency for the FastAPI backend[cite: 20, 22].

**ecohome.one LLC (Software Developer)**
* [cite_start]**Role:** Engineered an end-to-end voice-activated agent using **Amazon Alexa** and **LLMs** to parse e-receipts[cite: 26].
* [cite_start]**Architecture:** Designed a scalable, serverless backend using **Node.js on AWS Lambda** and **SQS** for fault-tolerant asynchronous processing[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]**Security:** Implemented a secure **OAuth 2.0** authentication flow to link user email accounts with the Alexa skill, ensuring data privacy[cite: 27].

**Scientist Technologies (Machine Learning Engineer)**
* [cite_start]**Impact:** Engineered "AI Physio," a computer vision pipeline that automated patient exercise validation, reducing delivery costs by **5%** for over **1,000 users**[cite: 31].
* [cite_start]**Optimization:** Pioneered a custom object detection model for medical device readings using **TensorFlow**, achieving **95% accuracy** after pivoting from an inefficient OCR framework[cite: 32].

## Technical Projects & Hackathons

**Candidate Search Application (HackUTA 2024)**
* [cite_start]**Solution:** Architected a search engine using **OpenAI embeddings** and a **FAISS vector index** to match natural language queries against candidate profiles[cite: 50].
* [cite_start]**Result:** Achieved **95% accuracy** in matching queries and developed a responsive Streamlit UI for recruiters[cite: 50, 51].

**Smart India Hackathon 2019 (Winner)**
* [cite_start]**Challenge:** Solved a complex logistics problem for optimizing container packing to reduce shipping costs[cite: 46].
* [cite_start]**Solution:** Architected a real-time **3D animated guide** using **C# and Unity Engine**, translating complex algorithms into visual workflows for factory workers[cite: 46, 47].
* [cite_start]**Leadership:** successfully advocated for tackling this difficult problem statement despite initial team hesitation ("Have Backbone"), leading the team to a national win[cite: 443, 447].

**AR Lego Guide (Research)**
* [cite_start]**Tech:** Developed an Augmented Reality prototype for **Meta Quest 3** using **Unity 3D** and **C#**[cite: 42, 43].
* [cite_start]**Innovation:** Implemented hand-gesture controls and 3D animations to assist in human factors research[cite: 44].

## Open Source & Community Leadership

**MOBI (Officer & Lead)**
* **Initiative:** Led the club's AI/ML initiatives. [cite_start]Built a Proof-of-Concept using the **Donut model** (Hugging Face) to perform Document Question Answering on tabletop RPG rulebooks, solving a "hallucination" problem common in standard LLMs[cite: 213, 218, 228].
* [cite_start]**Impact:** This initiative led to my promotion from general member to Officer[cite: 228].

**Community Engagement**
* [cite_start]**Roles:** Officer at [Open Source Lab](https://osl.netlify.app) and Volunteer at [IAN](https://www.ian.ong/) (Platform optimization and documentation)[cite: 7, 8].
* [cite_start]**Events:** Organized **Common Voice Sprint**, **Google Summer of Code** sessions, and **MozFest** presentations[cite: 5, 6].

## Technical Skills

* [cite_start]**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C#, SQL[cite: 36].
* [cite_start]**Cloud (AWS):** Lambda, SQS, S3, API Gateway, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch[cite: 39].
* [cite_start]**Frameworks:** FastAPI, Next.js, React, Node.js, Django, Flask[cite: 37].
* [cite_start]**AI/ML:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, LLM Integration (Gemini, OpenAI), LangChain, Vector Search (FAISS)[cite: 40].
* [cite_start]**DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions, Fly.io, CI/CD[cite: 38].

## Career Aspirations

I am seeking a role as a **Software Engineer** specializing in **Machine Learning** or **Backend Development**. [cite_start]I thrive in environments that require solving complex architectural challenges—such as building serverless pipelines or optimizing ML models for edge devices—and value a culture of open collaboration and technical excellence[cite: 10, 11].
