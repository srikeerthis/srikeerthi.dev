The aim of this project is to automate the process of extracting recipe data from various websites to build a comprehensive and structured recipe database. By leveraging the Scrapy framework, this project crawls different recipe sites, scrapes the relevant data, and stores it in a MongoDB database.

## Definitions

- **spiders** : Classes that define the custom behavior for crawling and parsing pages of a particular site (or, in some cases, a group of sites). They determine how the data is extracted and which pages to follow.
- **crawl** : The process of navigating through links and retrieving data from web pages.
- **scrape** : The process of extracting data from web pages.
- **items** : Data structures (usually dictionaries) that store the extracted data returned by spiders.
- **pipeline** : Python classes that process the extracted data. They receive items and perform actions such as cleaning the data, validating it, saving it to databases, or sending it to clients.
